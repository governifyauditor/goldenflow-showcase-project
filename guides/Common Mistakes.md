# Common Mistakes

- ## Pivotal Tracker Story Id in GitHub branch name

As described in the goldenflow showcase it is necessary to add the id code of the Stories to the name of the new branches for a correct linking.
Please make sure you have something similar to the following images in your repository.

Pivotal Tracker ID location:|  GitHub Branch name:
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:

- ## Start the story before creating the GitHub branch

You must ensure that you have correctly estimated and started the stories in Pivotal Tracker by clicking on the start button before creating the corresponding branch in your repo.
